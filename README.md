### Unfortunately, there is currently an issue with the API, but I am working on switching to another one.

The tech stack is:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript ES 6
- React 18
- Redux Toolkit/RTK Query
- React Router
- CSS3
- HTML5
- FlexBox
- Sass(Scss)
- BEM Methodology
- Webpack
- Node Package Manager

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <a>http://localhost:8080</a> to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
